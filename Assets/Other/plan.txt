Large
<> Improve Stable Diffusion Resolution
    Could use turbo, sdxl or a resolution increaser, or draw images in patches
[] Create NPC generation functionality
    Need to store a collection of NPCS (ids, names and details)
    NPC_Controller - List of NPC gameObjects
    NPC_Gameobject
        Mic - Controls what the NPC can hear (triggered by player and other NPCS)
        Controls - Lets the NPC randomly move or do other actions
        Appearance - AI Generated body and head (Images)
        Speakers - Controls what the NPC says
    NPC_LLMs - Python pipelines for dialogue / actions, store previous dialogue
    Can create a new NPC by triggering the converse command which will send appropriate messages to NPC_Controller and LLMs
    Ideally would have seperate nodes for each NPC to allow dynamic functionality but not possible at present
Medium
<X> Add better messaging when failing to create mesh
[] or alternatively use algorithm to split mesh into multiple parts
<X> Add UI for VR
    [] Handler status updates
    [] Loading animations
    <X> Debugger UI
<> Fix URP lighting
<> Test architecture on distributed setup
Small
[] Upgrade Whisper and or LLM to larger param models
<X> Use gtts after whisper to hear what the system thought you said
<> Parse glowing material for color


Future
<X> Add default paths to virtual network, ie gtts to speaker to allow undefined state transitions, for rare but necessary logic
