given a path/ or loop on a spheres surface
This loop can be mapped onto a rectangle in the uv coordinates, ie the biggest rectangle needed to contain it
however these rectangles while representing the space decently, arent appropriate for contextually infilling
as the uvs jump from 1 to 0 (seams) and become distorted near the poles
There for i suggest that we assume the loop is taking place centered at the lat 90 long 180, or uv (0.5,0.5)
as the loop is centered we can then fill in the loop in on a more normal space with no discontinuity
we can then apply a reverse transformation to distort the centered infill back to normal spherical coords and overlay it

algorithm
Given a loop, a list of spherical coordinates(ie (phi, theta) (0-180, 0-360))
find the min and max and range of phi and theta
if the range is less than half of the axis
	recenter all coordinates to be at lat 90 long 180
	Convert from spherical to uv
	send the recentered rectangle to stable diffusion to be drawn, with the pixels inside the loop as the mask
	receive the rectangle back
	decenter uv coordinates based on min max and range
	update old texture with new pixels
else say that loop is too big
